# Maximum subarray problem


#### About

The maximum subarray problem is the task of finding a contiguous subarray with the largest sum, within a given one-dimensional array of integers (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem). For example,

```
 0   1  2   3  4   5  6  7   8
[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
            *  *   *  * = 6 is the largest
```

Note:

- The array is a mixture of negative and positive integers (and can include 0).
- Report the last If there are more than one maximum 


#### Problem statement

Find the starting index number, the length, and the sum of the maximum subarray.
