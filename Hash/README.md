#### MD5

Take an input of a variable length and generate a 128 bits fixed lenght value.

1. Implement the MD5 function. Although the algorithm accepts a variable bits, you can implement only for bytes (multiple of 8 bits).
2. Use a ready-made MD5 function to verify if your implementation is correct.
