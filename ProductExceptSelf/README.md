# Product of array except self

#### About

I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSRFtR3pv74) and found it easy and fun. It appeared in an Apple job interview. 

#### Problem description

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `n > 1`, return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`. Do not use division!

Note: We are not after smaller O.

e.g., 

```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
output: [24, 12, 8, 6]
```
